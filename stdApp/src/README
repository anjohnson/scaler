This application selects code from base, overrides some code, adds new records
and device support, and produces files for consumption by user trees.

DBD
================================================================================

INPUT FILES
-----------
shareBase.dbd  -- selections from base.  This is a modified copy of base.dbd
                  (partially resolved .dbd file)
stdShare.dbd   -- additions from local code
                  (partially resolved .dbd file)
*Record.dbd    -- definitions of records, etc. supported this application.
                  stdShare.dbd includes these files
                  (incompletely resolved .dbd files)

OUTPUT FILES
------------
shareBase.dbd  -- this file should be included by user tree's *AppInclude.dbd
stdShare.dbd   -- this file should be included by user tree's *AppInclude.dbd
*Record.dbd    -- referenced by stdShare.dbd
